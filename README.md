Project Title: Voice Controlled Desktop Assistant

Project Abstract:
The goal of this project is to implement a voice assistant for the linux based system that enables the users to perform all the mundane computer activities through voice and achieve near human-like interaction between the user and our voice-assistant. The assistant aims towards eliminating the conventional methods of interacting with the  computer using keyboard and mouse.

The assistant listens to voice commands by the user, these commands are converted to text and parsed by the assistant to execute the required action. Each of these commands given by the user is logged onto a database. The data logged to the database is used to personalize features to the particular user. A user-interface is provided to help the users interact with the assistant.
